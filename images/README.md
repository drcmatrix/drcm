### Wheel

Back wheel consists of four sections and white outline for each. All colors are taken from devRant's color scheme:
- <code style="background: #69c9cd; color: black;">#69c9cd</code> - teal,
- <code style="background: #7bc8a4; color: black;">#7bc8a4</code> - green,
- <code style="background: #e6c653; color: black;">#e6c653</code> - yellow,
- <code style="background: #d55161; color: white;">#d55161</code> - red.

The arrangement of color sections may be reminiscing of the Slack logo.

### Stamp

dRCM Stamp Square with white backdrop is on top of the wheel, aligned by arcs' medians. The stamp's fill has this color: <code style="background: #433c5a; color: white;">#433c5a</code>.
